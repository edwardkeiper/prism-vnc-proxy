demo-ws-proxy.py

This script implements a WebSocket proxy server that forwards messages between
a client and a remote WebSocket server.

The proxy server listens for incoming WebSocket connections and establishes a
connection to a specified remote WebSocket server. Messages received from the
client are forwarded to the remote server, and messages received from the
remote server are forwarded to the client.

Functions:
    proxy_connection(websocket): Handles new connections to the proxy server.
    clientToServer(ws, websocket): Forwards messages from the client to the
        remote server.
    serverToClient(ws, websocket): Forwards messages from the remote server to
        the client.
    main(): Starts the WebSocket proxy server.

Usage:
    Run the script with optional arguments to specify the host, port, and
    remote WebSocket URL.
    
    Example: python demo-ws-proxy.py --host localhost --port 9998 --remote_url ws://localhost:9999

Arguments:
    --host: Host to bind to (default: 'localhost').
    --port: Port to bind to (default: 9998).
    --remote_url: Remote WebSocket URL (default: 'ws://localhost:9999').

Logging:
    The script logs various events and errors, including new connections,
    message forwarding, and connection closures.
