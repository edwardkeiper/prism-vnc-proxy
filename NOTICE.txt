original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works
shall not include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by
name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version
of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works

non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive,
no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise
transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims

alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such
litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

  a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of
    this License; and

  b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
    You changed the files; and

  c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
    distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from
    the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works; and

  d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then
    any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the

    along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the
    Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear.
    The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
    Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the
    NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices
    cannot be construed as modifying the License.

You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
with the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall

writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks

tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or
losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You
may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against,
such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
liability.

GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3.0 Only
--------------------------------------------------

"This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under
the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation[,][;] version 3 of the License."



GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
=================================

Version 3,Â Â 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, â€œthis Licenseâ€ refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the â€œGNU GPLâ€ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

â€œThe Libraryâ€ refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An â€œApplicationâ€ is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of
a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by
the Library.

A â€œCombined Workâ€ is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with
the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work
was made is also called the â€œLinked Versionâ€.

The â€œMinimal Corresponding Sourceâ€ for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
not on the Linked Version.

The â€œCorresponding Application Codeâ€ for a Combined Work means the object code
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
you may convey a copy of the modified version:

  * a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
    that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
    facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
    meaningful, or

  * b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License
    applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of
your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
following:

  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
    is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

  * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained
in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if
you also do each of the following:

  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library
    is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

  * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

  * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
    include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
    a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

  * d) Do one of the following:

      * 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
        and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
        Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
        modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
        GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

      * 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
        A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the
        Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will
        operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
        interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

  * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
    required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
    to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
    modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
    the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
    option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
    4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
    section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

  * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
    Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
    terms of this License.

  * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work
    based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
    uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License â€œor any later versionâ€ applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization
for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

Version 3,Â Â 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.


Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other
kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.
You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there
is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL
requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change
the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products
for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for
those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

â€œThis Licenseâ€ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

â€œCopyrightâ€ also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

â€œThe Programâ€ refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each
licensee is addressed as â€œyouâ€. â€œLicenseesâ€ and â€œrecipientsâ€ may be individuals
or organizations.

To â€œmodifyâ€ a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a â€œmodified versionâ€ of the earlier work or a work
â€œbased onâ€ the earlier work.

A â€œcovered workâ€ means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

To â€œpropagateâ€ a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To â€œconveyâ€ a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays â€œAppropriate Legal Noticesâ€ to the extent
that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays
an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a
prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The â€œsource codeâ€ for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. â€œObject codeâ€ means any non-source form of a work.

A â€œStandard Interfaceâ€ means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.

The â€œSystem Librariesâ€ of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A â€œMajor Componentâ€, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

The â€œCorresponding Sourceâ€ for a work in object code form means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by
intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material
for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered
works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted
material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention
of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by
exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you
disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in
any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this
License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
    giving a relevant date.

  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
    modifies the requirement in section 4 to â€œkeep intact all noticesâ€.

  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
    such permission if you have separately received it.

  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not
    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which
are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium, is called an â€œaggregateâ€ if the compilation and its
resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code
    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in
    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not
    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
    needed to satisfy these requirements.

  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
object code work.

A â€œUser Productâ€ is either (1) a â€œconsumer productâ€, which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
user, â€œnormally usedâ€ refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
significant mode of use of the product.

â€œInstallation Informationâ€ for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified
versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its
Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically
for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in
which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the
recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object
code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

â€œAdditional permissionsâ€ are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that
are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you
modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you
to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed
    by works containing it; or

  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
    different from the original version; or

  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
    of the material; or

  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
    trademarks, or service marks; or

  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered â€œfurther restrictionsâ€
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part
of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a
term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of
this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to
receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

An â€œentity transactionâ€ is a transaction transferring control of an organization,
or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity
transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the
predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,
royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and
you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

A â€œcontributorâ€ is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
called the contributor's â€œcontributor versionâ€.

A contributor's â€œessential patent claimsâ€ are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version. For purposes of this definition, â€œcontrolâ€ includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a â€œpatent licenseâ€ is any express agreement or
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).
To â€œgrantâ€ such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network
server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of
the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. â€œKnowingly relyingâ€ means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a
country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe
are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them
to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the
covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ if it does not include within the scope of
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of
one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make
payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you
under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both
those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link
or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU
Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General
Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply
to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License â€œor any later
versionâ€ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU
General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance
of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,
no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM â€œAS ISâ€ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the â€œcopyrightâ€ line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

 <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
does.>
Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
(at your option) any later version.

This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the
GNU General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
along with this program. If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

 <program> Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be
different; for a GUI interface, you would use an â€œabout boxâ€.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a â€œcopyright disclaimerâ€ for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of
this License. But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
=================================

Version 3,Â Â 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and
conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, â€œthis Licenseâ€ refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General
Public License, and the â€œGNU GPLâ€ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public
License.

â€œThe Libraryâ€ refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an
Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An â€œApplicationâ€ is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the
Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of
a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by
the Library.

A â€œCombined Workâ€ is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with
the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work
was made is also called the â€œLinked Versionâ€.

The â€œMinimal Corresponding Sourceâ€ for a Combined Work means the Corresponding
Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the
Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and
not on the Linked Version.

The â€œCorresponding Application Codeâ€ for a Combined Work means the object code
and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs
needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the
System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without
being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying Modified Versions.

If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility
refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the
facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then
you may convey a copy of the modified version:

  * a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure
    that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the
    facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains
    meaningful, or

  * b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License
    applicable to that copy.

3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.

The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header
file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of
your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros,
inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the
following:

  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library
    is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

  * b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

4. Combined Works.

You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,
effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained
in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if
you also do each of the following:

  * a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library
    is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.

  * b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

  * c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,
    include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as
    a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license
    document.

  * d) Do one of the following:

      * 0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
        License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,
        and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the
        Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a
        modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU
        GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.

      * 1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
        A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the
        Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will
        operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is
        interface-compatible with the Linked Version.

  * e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be
    required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only
    to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a
    modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking
    the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use
    option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
    Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option
    4d1, you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by
    section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

5. Combined Libraries.

You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by
side in a single library together with other library facilities that are not
Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined
library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:

  * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the
    Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the
    terms of this License.

  * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work
    based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
    uncombined form of the same work.

6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new
problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you
received it specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
Public License â€œor any later versionâ€ applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any
later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether
future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that
proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization
for you to choose that version for the Library.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
==========================

Version 3,Â Â 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <http://fsf.org/>

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.


Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software and other
kinds of works.

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program--to make sure it remains free software for all its users.
We, the Free Software Foundation, use the GNU General Public License for most of
our software; it applies also to any other work released this way by its authors.
You can apply it to your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price. Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you can do
these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have certain
responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert
copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there
is no warranty for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the GPL
requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so that their problems will
not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to change
the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products
for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.
Therefore, we have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for
those products. If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions of the GPL, as
needed to protect the freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL assures that patents cannot be used to
render the program non-free.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.


TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

â€œThis Licenseâ€ refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

â€œCopyrightâ€ also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of works,
such as semiconductor masks.

â€œThe Programâ€ refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this License. Each
licensee is addressed as â€œyouâ€. â€œLicenseesâ€ and â€œrecipientsâ€ may be individuals
or organizations.

To â€œmodifyâ€ a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work in a
fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an exact copy.
The resulting work is called a â€œmodified versionâ€ of the earlier work or a work
â€œbased onâ€ the earlier work.

A â€œcovered workâ€ means either the unmodified Program or a work based on the
Program.

To â€œpropagateâ€ a work means to do anything with it that, without permission,
would make you directly or secondarily liable for infringement under applicable
copyright law, except executing it on a computer or modifying a private copy.
Propagation includes copying, distribution (with or without modification), making
available to the public, and in some countries other activities as well.

To â€œconveyâ€ a work means any kind of propagation that enables other parties to
make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a computer network,
with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

An interactive user interface displays â€œAppropriate Legal Noticesâ€ to the extent
that it includes a convenient and prominently visible feature that (1) displays
an appropriate copyright notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
for the work (except to the extent that warranties are provided), that licensees
may convey the work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.
If the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a menu, a
prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

1. Source Code.

The â€œsource codeâ€ for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. â€œObject codeâ€ means any non-source form of a work.

A â€œStandard Interfaceâ€ means an interface that either is an official standard
defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces specified
for a particular programming language, one that is widely used among developers
working in that language.

The â€œSystem Librariesâ€ of an executable work include anything, other than the
work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
Component, but which is not part of that Major Component, and (b) serves only to
enable use of the work with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
Interface for which an implementation is available to the public in source code
form. A â€œMajor Componentâ€, in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system (if any) on
which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the work, or an
object code interpreter used to run it.

The â€œCorresponding Sourceâ€ for a work in object code form means all the source
code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the object
code and to modify the work, including scripts to control those activities.
However, it does not include the work's System Libraries, or general-purpose
tools or generally available free programs which are used unmodified in
performing those activities but which are not part of the work. For example,
Corresponding Source includes interface definition files associated with source
files for the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require, such as by
intimate data communication or control flow between those subprograms and other
parts of the work.

The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users can regenerate
automatically from other parts of the Corresponding Source.

The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that same work.

2. Basic Permissions.

All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of copyright on
the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to run the unmodified
Program. The output from running a covered work is covered by this License only
if the output, given its content, constitutes a covered work. This License
acknowledges your rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by
copyright law.

You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not convey, without
conditions so long as your license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
covered works to others for the sole purpose of having them make modifications
exclusively for you, or provide you with facilities for running those works,
provided that you comply with the terms of this License in conveying all material
for which you do not control copyright. Those thus making or running the covered
works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction and
control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of your copyrighted
material outside their relationship with you.

Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under the conditions
stated below. Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.

3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological measure under
any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO copyright
treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar laws prohibiting or restricting
circumvention of such measures.

When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid circumvention
of technological measures to the extent such circumvention is effected by
exercising rights under this License with respect to the covered work, and you
disclaim any intention to limit operation or modification of the work as a means
of enforcing, against the work's users, your or third parties' legal rights to
forbid circumvention of technological measures.

4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in
any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all notices stating that this
License and any non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the
code; keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey, and you may
offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it
from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4,
provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

  * a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and
    giving a relevant date.

  * b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under
    this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement
    modifies the requirement in section 4 to â€œkeep intact all noticesâ€.

  * c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone
    who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along
    with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and
    all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate
    such permission if you have separately received it.

  * d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate
    Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not
    display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent works, which
are not by their nature extensions of the covered work, and which are not
combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium, is called an â€œaggregateâ€ if the compilation and its
resulting copyright are not used to limit the access or legal rights of the
compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a
covered work in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms of sections 4
and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source
under the terms of this License, in one of these ways:

  * a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by the Corresponding Source fixed
    on a durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

  * b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product (including a
    physical distribution medium), accompanied by a written offer, valid for at
    least three years and valid for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
    support for that product model, to give anyone who possesses the object code
    either (1) a copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange, for a price no more than your
    reasonable cost of physically performing this conveying of source, or (2)
    access to copy the Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

  * c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the written
    offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This alternative is allowed only
    occasionally and noncommercially, and only if you received the object code
    with such an offer, in accord with subsection 6b.

  * d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated place (gratis
    or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the Corresponding Source in
    the same way through the same place at no further charge. You need not
    require recipients to copy the Corresponding Source along with the object
    code. If the place to copy the object code is a network server, the
    Corresponding Source may be on a different server (operated by you or a third
    party) that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the Corresponding
    Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is available for as long as
    needed to satisfy these requirements.

  * e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided you
    inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding Source of the work
    are being offered to the general public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded from the
Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be included in conveying the
object code work.

A â€œUser Productâ€ is either (1) a â€œconsumer productâ€, which means any tangible
personal property which is normally used for personal, family, or household
purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation into a dwelling. In
determining whether a product is a consumer product, doubtful cases shall be
resolved in favor of coverage. For a particular product received by a particular
user, â€œnormally usedâ€ refers to a typical or common use of that class of product,
regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way in which the
particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product. A
product is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only
significant mode of use of the product.

â€œInstallation Informationâ€ for a User Product means any methods, procedures,
authorization keys, or other information required to install and execute modified
versions of a covered work in that User Product from a modified version of its
Corresponding Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the continued
functioning of the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered
with solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or specifically
for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in
which the right of possession and use of the User Product is transferred to the
recipient in perpetuity or for a fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be
accompanied by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install modified object
code on the User Product (for example, the work has been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates for a
work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
Product in which it has been modified or installed. Access to a network may be
denied when the modification itself materially and adversely affects the
operation of the network or violates the rules and protocols for communication
across the network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided, in accord
with this section must be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
implementation available to the public in source code form), and must require no
special password or key for unpacking, reading or copying.

7. Additional Terms.

â€œAdditional permissionsâ€ are terms that supplement the terms of this License by
making exceptions from one or more of its conditions. Additional permissions that
are applicable to the entire Program shall be treated as though they were
included in this License, to the extent that they are valid under applicable law.
If additional permissions apply only to part of the Program, that part may be
used separately under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed
by this License without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option remove any
additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of it. (Additional
permissions may be written to require their own removal in certain cases when you
modify the work.) You may place additional permissions on material, added by you
to a covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate copyright
permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you add to a
covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
supplement the terms of this License with terms:

  * a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the terms of
    sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

  * b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or author
    attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal Notices displayed
    by works containing it; or

  * c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or requiring
    that modified versions of such material be marked in reasonable ways as
    different from the original version; or

  * d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or authors
    of the material; or

  * e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some trade names,
    trademarks, or service marks; or

  * f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that material by
    anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of it) with contractual
    assumptions of liability to the recipient, for any liability that these
    contractual assumptions directly impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered â€œfurther restrictionsâ€
within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any part
of it, contains a notice stating that it is governed by this License along with a
term that is a further restriction, you may remove that term. If a license
document contains a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying
under this License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does not survive
such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you must place,
in the relevant source files, a statement of the additional terms that apply to
those files, or a notice indicating where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the form of a
separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
either way.

8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly provided under
this License. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License (including any patent
licenses granted under the third paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a
particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b)
permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some
reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated
permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some
reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of
this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the
violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of
parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your
rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, you do not qualify to
receive new licenses for the same material under section 10.

9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of
the Program. Ancillary propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to receive a copy likewise does
not require acceptance. However, nothing other than this License grants you
permission to propagate or modify any covered work. These actions infringe
copyright if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or
propagating a covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so.

10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically receives a
license from the original licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
subject to this License. You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties with this License.

An â€œentity transactionâ€ is a transaction transferring control of an organization,
or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an organization, or merging
organizations. If propagation of a covered work results from an entity
transaction, each party to that transaction who receives a copy of the work also
receives whatever licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or
could give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if the
predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the rights granted
or affirmed under this License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,
royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted under this License, and
you may not initiate litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a
lawsuit) alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling,
offering for sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

11. Patents.

A â€œcontributorâ€ is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of
the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The work thus licensed is
called the contributor's â€œcontributor versionâ€.

A contributor's â€œessential patent claimsâ€ are all patent claims owned or
controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired,
that would be infringed by some manner, permitted by this License, of making,
using, or selling its contributor version, but do not include claims that would
be infringed only as a consequence of further modification of the contributor
version. For purposes of this definition, â€œcontrolâ€ includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of this License.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free patent
license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to make, use, sell,
offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and propagate the contents of
its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a â€œpatent licenseâ€ is any express agreement or
commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an express
permission to practice a patent or covenant not to sue for patent infringement).
To â€œgrantâ€ such a patent license to a party means to make such an agreement or
commitment not to enforce a patent against the party.

If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license, and the
Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone to copy, free of
charge and under the terms of this License, through a publicly available network
server or other readily accessible means, then you must either (1) cause the
Corresponding Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of
the benefit of the patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a
manner consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients. â€œKnowingly relyingâ€ means you have actual
knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the covered work in a
country, or your recipient's use of the covered work in a country, would infringe
one or more identifiable patents in that country that you have reason to believe
are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or arrangement, you
convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
patent license to some of the parties receiving the covered work authorizing them
to use, propagate, modify or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
patent license you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the
covered work and works based on it.

A patent license is â€œdiscriminatoryâ€ if it does not include within the scope of
its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the non-exercise of
one or more of the rights that are specifically granted under this License. You
may not convey a covered work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third
party that is in the business of distributing software, under which you make
payment to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties who would
receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license (a) in
connection with copies of the covered work conveyed by you (or copies made from
those copies), or (b) primarily for and in connection with specific products or
compilations that contain the covered work, unless you entered into that
arrangement, or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting any implied
license or other defenses to infringement that may otherwise be available to you
under applicable patent law.

12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise)
that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a covered work so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if
you agree to terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could satisfy both
those terms and this License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the
Program.

13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have permission to link
or combine any covered work with a work licensed under version 3 of the GNU
Affero General Public License into a single combined work, and to convey the
resulting work. The terms of this License will continue to apply to the part
which is the covered work, but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General
Public License, section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply
to the combination as such.

14. Revised Versions of this License.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program specifies
that a certain numbered version of the GNU General Public License â€œor any later
versionâ€ applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that numbered version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the GNU
General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free
Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of the GNU
General Public License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance
of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different permissions. However,
no additional obligations are imposed on any author or copyright holder as a
result of your choosing to follow a later version.

15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM â€œAS ISâ€ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER
EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE
THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED
INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE
PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY
HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided above cannot
be given local legal effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
apply local law that most closely approximates an absolute waiver of all civil
liability in connection with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS


How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software which
everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively state the exclusion of
warranty; and each file should have at least the â€œcopyrightâ€ line and a pointer
to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it
does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program does terminal interaction, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

    <program>  Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate parts
of the General Public License. Of course, your program's commands might be
different; for a GUI interface, you would use an â€œabout boxâ€.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school, if
any, to sign a â€œcopyright disclaimerâ€ for the program, if necessary. For more
information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may consider
it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the library. If
this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public License instead of
this License. But first, please read
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html>.

--------------------------------


  2.1. Grants

  Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free, non-exclusive
  license:

    a. 

      under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)
      Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify,
      display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its Contributions,
      either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or as part of a Larger

    b. 

      under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for sale,
      have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
      Contributor Version.


  2.2. Effective Date

  The licenses granted in SectionÂ 2.1 with respect to any Contribution become
  effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first distributes
  such Contribution.


  2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope

  The licenses granted in this SectionÂ 2 are the only rights granted under this
  License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
  or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding
  SectionÂ 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:

    a. 

      for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software; or

    b. 

      for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party's
      modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its
      Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor
      Version); or

    c. 

      under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of its
      Contributions.

  This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks, or
  logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
  requirements in SectionÂ 3.4).


  2.4. Subsequent Licenses

  No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to distribute
  the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see
  SectionÂ 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
  terms of SectionÂ 3.3).


  2.5. Representation

  Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its Contributions are
  its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the rights to its
  Contributions conveyed by this License.


  2.6. Fair Use

  This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under applicable
  copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.


  2.7. Conditions

  Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
  SectionÂ 2.1.


3. Responsibilities
-------------------


  3.1. Distribution of Source Form

  All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
  Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the
  terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of
  the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can
  obtain a copy of this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the
  recipients' rights in the Source Code Form.


  3.2. Distribution of Executable Form

  If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:

    a. 

      such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form, as
      described in SectionÂ 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable
      Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable
      means in a timely manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution
      to the recipient; and

    b. 

      You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this License, or
      sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
      Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients' rights
      in the Source Code Form under this License.


  3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work

  You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
  provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the
  Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with
  a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is
  not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to
  additionally distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary
  License(s), so that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option,
  further distribute the Covered Software under the terms of either this License
  or such Secondary License(s).


  3.4. Notices

  You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices (including
  copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or limitations of
  liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered Software,
  except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to remedy
  known factual inaccuracies.


  3.5. Application of Additional Terms

  You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity
  or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
  However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
  Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby
  agree to indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such
  Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You
  offer. You may include additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of
  liability specific to any jurisdiction.


4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
---------------------------------------------------

If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this License with
respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial order, or
regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they
affect. Such description must be placed in a text file included with all
distributions of the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent
prohibited by statute or regulation, such description must be sufficiently
detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.


5. Termination
--------------

  5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically if You
  fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
  the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are
  reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and
  finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such
  Contributor fails to notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means
  prior to 60 days after You have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your
  grants from a particular Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such
  Contributor notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this
  is the first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
  from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after Your
  receipt of the notice.

  5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
  infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
  cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all
  Contributors for the Covered Software under SectionÂ 2.1 of this License shall
  terminate.

  5.3. In the event of termination under SectionsÂ 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end user
  license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
  validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to
  termination shall survive termination.


6. Disclaimer of Warranty
-------------------------

Covered Software is provided under this License on an "as is" basis, without
warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, without
limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as
to the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any
Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume
the cost of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of
warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered
Software is authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.


7. Limitation of Liability
--------------------------

Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work
stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
damages or losses, even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility
of such damages. This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
death or personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the extent
applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the
exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion
and limitation may not apply to You.


8. Litigation
-------------

Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a
jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference
to its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a
party's ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.


9. Miscellaneous
----------------

This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject matter
hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against
a Contributor.


10. Versions of the License
---------------------------


  10.1. New Versions

  Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in SectionÂ 10.3,
  no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
  versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
  number.


  10.2. Effect of New Versions

  You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
  terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.


  10.3. Modified Versions

  If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to create a
  new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
  this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of
  the license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from
  this License).


  10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
  Licenses

  If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
  Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
  described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.


Exhibit A - Source Code Form License Notice
-------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is subject to the terms of the Mozilla Public License,
  v. 2.0. If a copy of the MPL was not distributed with this file, You can
  obtain one at http://mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/.

If it is not possible or desirable to put the notice in a particular file, then
You may include the notice in a location (such as a LICENSE file in a relevant
directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.

You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.


Exhibit B - "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses" Notice
---------------------------------------------------------

  This Source Code Form is "Incompatible With Secondary Licenses", as defined
  by the Mozilla Public License, v. 2.0.

Python Software Foundation License 2.0
(aiohappyeyeballs 2.4.4, py3-typing-extensions 4.12.2, python-distlib 0.3.9)

This license was approved as the official PSF License Version 2 on October 22,
2004. The only differences between this and version 1 of the PSF license consist
of removing Python version numbers (like 2.1.1 or 2.3).



PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2
============================================

--------------------------------------------

  1.  This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation ("PSF"),
    and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise using
    this software ("Python") in source or binary form and its associated
    documentation.

  2.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF hereby
    grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to
    reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare derivative
    works, distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any derivative
    version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and PSF's notice of
    copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004 Python Software
    Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are retained in Python alone or in any
    derivative version prepared by Licensee.

  3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
    incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative
    work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees to
    include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.

  4.  PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis. PSF MAKES
    NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, BUT
    NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR WARRANTY OF
    MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF
    PYTHON WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

  5.  PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON FOR ANY
    INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
    MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
    THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

  6.  This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material breach
