demo-ws-client.py

This script demonstrates a simple WebSocket client using the `websockets`
library in Python. The client connects to a WebSocket server running on
localhost at port 9998, sends a greeting message to the server, and prints
the response received from the server.

Usage:
    python3 demo-ws-client.py

Functions:
    - connect(): Asynchronous function that establishes a WebSocket
                 connection, sends a message, and prints the server's
                 response.

    Establishes a WebSocket connection to a server, sends a greeting message,
    and handles the response.

    This function attempts to connect to a WebSocket server at the specified 
    URI. Upon successful connection, it sends a "Hello, Server!" message to 
    the server and waits for a response. The function logs the connection 
    status, sent message, and received response. It also handles and logs any 
    exceptions that occur during the connection and communication process.

    Exceptions Handled:
        - websockets.exceptions.ConnectionClosedError: Raised when the 
          connection is closed unexpectedly.
        - Exception: Catches any other exceptions that may occur during the 
          connection or communication.

    Logging:
        - Logs an attempt to connect to the server.
        - Logs a successful connection to the server.
        - Logs the sent message.
        - Logs the received response from the server.
        - Logs any errors that occur during the connection or communication.

    Usage:
        This function should be called within an asyncio event loop.

    Example:
        asyncio.run(connect())
