Enhance VNC proxy service with environment variable support

This commit improves the VNC proxy service configuration by:

1. Adding support for loading configuration from a .env file
2. Updating the systemd service file to use environment variables
3. Enhancing documentation with security best practices
4. Adding troubleshooting guidance for environment variable issues
5. Documenting signal handling for graceful shutdown

These changes make the service more maintainable by:
- Separating configuration from service definition
- Making it easier to update credentials without modifying the service file
- Improving security by restricting access to sensitive information
- Ensuring proper cleanup of resources during service shutdown

The implementation uses systemd's EnvironmentFile directive to load
variables from .env and passes them as command-line arguments to the
Python script, requiring no changes to the application code itself.
