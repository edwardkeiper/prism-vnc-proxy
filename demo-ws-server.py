"""
demo-ws-server.py

This script sets up a simple WebSocket server using the aiohttp library.
The server listens on all network interfaces at port 9999 and accepts
WebSocket connections. Upon accepting a connection, it sends the remote
address of the client back to the client and then closes the connection.

Modules:
    asyncio: Provides support for asynchronous programming.
    aiohttp.web: Provides the web server and WebSocket support.

Functions:
    websocket_handler(request: web.Request) -> web.StreamResponse:
        Handles incoming WebSocket connections, sends the client's remote
        address, and closes the connection.

    main():
        Sets up and starts the WebSocket server, and keeps it running
        indefinitely.

Usage:
    Run this script directly to start the WebSocket server.
